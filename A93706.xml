            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving been Crui≈øing for ≈øeveral days before <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> the Twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> being off at Sea, ≈øome Five or ≈øix Leagues, I met with the <hi>Mary, Hamp≈øhire, Port≈ømouth,</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> Fregats; and upon the notice they brought me of ≈øeveral <hi>Argiers</hi> Men of War being at <hi>Bugia,</hi> I called a Council of War, and it was voted, and thought fit, That I ≈øhould make the be≈øt of my way (the Wind being then Ea≈øterly) to ply up thither with the <hi>Mary, Warwick, Advice, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Port≈ømouth Pink,</hi> and the Fire≈øhips, to endeavor the de≈øtroying them; the <hi>Hamp≈øhire</hi> and <hi>Port≈ømouth</hi> Fregats being left to crui≈øe off of <hi>Argiers</hi> till further order. The <hi>Dragon</hi> had been gone five days in chace of Two <hi>Argier</hi> Men of War, the Winds being then at S.

            <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->
            <p>The Twenty third, the <hi>Dragon</hi> came into me, having been two days in fight with the Two <hi>Argier</hi> Men of War which he cha≈øed, Capt. <hi>Herbert</hi> the Commander, being ≈øhot in the Face with a Musket ≈øhot, and Nine or ten of his men wounded with ≈ømall ≈øhot, who will all recover.</p>
            <p>Until the Twenty eighth, the Winds were always Ea≈øterly, the ≈øame day, about Eight at Night, the Wind came up to the South We≈øt, with very great Gu≈øts and Rain, which di≈øabled my <hi>Little Eagle</hi> Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, leaving her not one Ma≈øt ≈øtanding.</p>
            <p>The Thirtieth, I had got her Ma≈øted and Rigged again fit for ≈øervice, having luckily a Corn Boat with me taken from the Enemy, which with the help of other Topma≈øts and Booms, Ma≈øted her. In this Weather, the <hi>Warwick</hi> hapned to ≈øpring her Main Ma≈øt again, and bore away to the Chri≈øtian ≈øhore; my <hi>Brigantine</hi> at the ≈øame time bore away, and as yet I have no news of her. The ≈øame day I got into <hi>Bugia</hi> Bay, and had a gale, which I thought would have carried me and my Fire≈øhips in upon them; but by that time we got within half ≈øhot of their Ca≈øtles and Forts, it proved dead calm, and afterward the Wind came off the ≈øhore, and a little further in the Road quite contrary.</p>
            <p>The Second of <hi>May,</hi> the Winds being ≈øo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, after having twice attempted with my Ships, and not able to do ≈øervice, for want of a certain Wind, every half hour bringing a ≈øeveral Wind with it, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to make an Attempt upon them in the night with my Boats, and the ≈ømalle≈øt of my Fire≈øhips which row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as a Long-Boat: About Twelve a Clock at Night, I ≈øent out all the Boats I could make, and the <hi>Eagle</hi> Fire≈øhip, under the command of my Elde≈øt Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Ma≈øter <hi>Nugent;</hi> but the Night proving very dark, and the high Land ob≈øcuring the Ships as they neer'd them, they pa≈ø≈øed by the Ships (Lieutenant

The Enemy then taking the Alarm, it was not convenient for the Boats to attempt boarding and burning them, they being full of Men. Had not this misfortune of the Fire≈øhip hapned, they might at this time have been de≈øtroyed without the lo≈øs of a Man. The next day they unrigged all their Ships, and made a Boom with their Yards, Topma≈øts, and Cables, buoyed up with Cask; in all which time we had no opportunity of Wind to do any thing upon them. My other little Fire≈øhip being ready primed, by an accident of a Pi≈øtol fired by the Gunner, took fire, and was lo≈øt; all my hopes and dependency relying upon her to do this bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, in regard of her little draught of Water. Now having nothing to tru≈øt to, but the <hi>Little Victory,</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently gave order to have her lightned to as ≈ømall a draught of water as could be, and brought her to eight foot.</p>
            <p>On Munday Morning, being the Eighth of <hi>May,</hi> came to them ≈øeveral Recruits, both of Hor≈øe and Foot, with Ammunition, as we ≈øuppo≈øe, from <hi>Argier,</hi> which they welcomed with great triumph by their firing of Guns from the Ships and Ca≈øtles, and putting abroad their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. But not knowing what other Recruits might come, I took the fir≈øt opportunity, and about Noon, the ≈øame day, it plea≈øed God to favor us with a fair moderate Breeze at Ea≈øt, though after I had made the ≈øigns for my Men of War to draw into a Line, and fall on, the Wind dollour'd again, which made me de≈øpair of being able to attack them: But it plea≈øed God to order it ≈øo, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152751:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->about Two a Clock, the Gale came in as before; the <hi>Dragon, Advice,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> borrowed too much of the South-We≈øt ≈øhore; ≈øo that they were forced to let go their Anchors in Three Fathom and half Water, and ≈øo veered in, bringing their Ships broad ≈øide to pa≈øs: I my ≈øelf came to an Anchor in Four Fathom, clo≈øe under their Ca≈øtles and Walls, battering all of us upon their Ships and Ca≈øtles for the ≈øpace of Two hours. I ≈øent in my Pinnace, the <hi>Maries</hi> and <hi>Dragons,</hi> to cut the Boom, which was very bravely performed, Lieutenant <hi>Pin</hi> commanding the <hi>Maries</hi> Boat, Lieut. <hi>Pierce</hi> the <hi>Dragons,</hi> and one <hi>Harman</hi> (a Reformado Seaman of mine) my own Pinnace; my Second Lieutenant, Mr. <hi>Earnly</hi> being hurt with a ≈øplinter in the Leg, and could not go; Eight of the <hi>Maries</hi> Boats Crew, and the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant were wounded with ≈ømall ≈øhot; Ten of the <hi>Dragons,</hi> and the Lieutenant wounded, and One killed; Seven killed out right in my own Pinnace, and all the re≈øt wounded except <hi>Harman</hi> that commanded. The Boom being then cut, I made the ≈øign for my Fire≈øhip to fall on: It plea≈øed Almighty God to order it ≈øo, That ≈øhe got in, and brought up athwart of their Bolt-≈øprits, their Ships being aground, and fa≈øt to the Ca≈øtles, burnt very well, and de≈øtroyed them all, there being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Ten Sail; Seven of which, were the be≈øt Men of War belonging to <hi>Argiers.</hi> Capt. <hi>Harris,</hi> Commander of the Fire≈øhip, his Ma≈øters Mate, Gunner, and one of his Seamen, are de≈øperately wounded with ≈ømall ≈øhot; but I fore≈øeeing the de≈øperatene≈øs and danger of the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that was to be done, Commi≈ø≈øionated a ≈øecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander <hi>Henry Williams,</hi> one of my Ma≈øters Mates, and late Commander of the <hi>Ro≈øe</hi> Fire≈øhip, to take the charge upon him there on Board, in ca≈øe the other ≈øhould mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, which he did accordingly, and performed it very well.

            <p>Upon the Tenth, about Eleven a Clock at Night, a <hi>Dutchman</hi> who hath been a Slave in <hi>Argiers</hi> for three years (and now with his Patron who commanded one of the≈øe Ships) made his e≈øcape by ≈øwimming on Board me, and told me for certain, That they confe≈øs 360 of their be≈øt Men and upwards, all <hi>Turks,</hi> Soldiers in Pay, lo≈øt their lives on Board the re≈øpective Ships, by Fire and Gun-≈øhot, not being able to get a≈øhore.
